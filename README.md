# Java Web-App Assignment
### TODO
- [ ] login functionality 
  - [x] storing the logged in user in session
  - [x] displaying the user's first name in home page
  - [x] remember me cookie
  - [ ] auth check on redirect requests
  
- [ ] error messages need to be polished (I put in a placeholder error message)

- [ ] confirmation page needs to be implemented (for when successful insert into database)

- [ ] GroupHandler needs to be finished 
  - right now, the information only displays in the drop down boxes if the submit button is pressed 
  - need to figure out a way to populate the drop down boxes when the page loads
  - it might turn out that the only way to do this is to have the database query directly in the jsp which is horrible and ugly but will probably work alright
  
- [x] go through the website and test the navigation 
  - (noticed some mismatch between the links in the menu and the jsps)
